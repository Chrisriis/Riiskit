#Riiskit

Riiskit is a clean WordPress theme for webdevelopers. It's based on TwentyFifteen, HTML5 Boilerplate and SMACSS.

Don't mistake it for a theme framework. It's just a simple, yet powerful and highly polished theme to get you started without getting in your way.

##Notes
* To enable the mobile menu, you must first pick a choice in the "Appearence -> Customize".
* A coming version of _libsass_ will allow me to compile the CSS files with output style _expanded_. This will make it easier for CSS coders to edit the files.

##Features
* SASS, OOCSS, BEM and SMACSS
* Choose between using a slideout and toggle -mobilemenu using the native WP Customizer.
* Lots of useful template tags.
* Lots of useful CSS helper classes and mixins.
* IE8+
* Vanilla, semantic, accessible, neatly organized and well documented code.
